# Portfolio Projects

This is a repository of different projects I've worked on by myself to showcase different skillsets typical of a Data Scientist, or Analyst.
It show cases different interests and will continue to grow and be worked upon as I discover new datasets, new techniques, and new insights.
It also possesses comments to show my thought process during the work, which I hope will read like a story of some workflows.
This is primarily for recruiters and hiring teams to have some snippets of work and code from me during the hiring process.

I hope it shows both initiative, appreciation, as well as a mentality for learning and growth.

Thank you for your time.
